MATLAB implementation of Material Knowledge System for predicting stress--strain responses in non-linear two-phase composites as presented in Latypov et al., 2018. 

## Contents

`predict_response` -- example script showing how to use the calibrated linkages for prediction of responses (effective strength and strain rate partitioning) for two-phase microstructure(s) 

`predict_ss_linear` -- example script showing how to use the calibrated linkages for prediction of stress--strain curves of composites with phases exhibiting linear strain hardening behavior

`predict_ss_power` -- example script showing how to use the calibrated linkages for prediction of stress--strain curves of composites with phases exhibiting power-law strain hardening behavior
